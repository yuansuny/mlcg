This archive contains graph instances generated using a genetic algorithm, with the aim of diversifying the available set of graphs. The data set is used to compare performance of graph colouring algorithms with respect to instance properties.

The method used is described in the following paper:
Smith-Miles, K. A. and Bowly, S., "Generating New Test Instances by Evolving in Instance Space", Computers & Operations Research

Instances are described in the format specified for the DIMACS challenges (see ccformat.ps, included).
